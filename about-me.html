            <h3>Work History</h3>
            <p>I have spent the last 13 years working as a Secondary School teacher teaching Digital Technology, Business and Accounting at an all-girl's school in Brisbane. During this time, I have loved teaching girls and young women how to use digital technology and inspired many to pursue careers in this industry. I plan on using a career in technology to continue to do this.</p>
            <p>My favourite aspect of working as a teacher was designing digital learning resources including videos, interactive online quizzes, games and activities.  I have created over 70 videos incorporating a range of techniques such as role plays, interviews, lectures, screencasts and lightboard technology. Examples of my educational videos can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHMJRq1XjQHDDXFRtltP4A" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

            </figure>
            <p>In 2018 I was asked to deliver a workshop to over 40 people on how to embed technology into the classroom at the <a href="https://www.beaq.org.au/">Business Educator's Association of Queensland</a> conference.  This workshop gave attendees the skillset to use Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint to design learning resources which provide students with immediate feedback on their work.</p>
            <p>A key highlight from my career as a teacher has been taking students on overseas trips to India, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Sri Lanka.  With the support of another teacher and guide we lead groups of between 14 and 22 students on leadership expeditions.  I helped these young women overcome homesickness, build resilience and encouraged them to develop social responsibility through rewarding community service projects.  </p>

            <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
            <p>In my free time I am an avid rock climber who climbs indoors or outdoors at least two times a week. I also enjoy canyoning, mountain biking and multi-day hiking. An ideal weekend for me would be time in nature, surrounded by loved ones while camping under the stars.   I also enjoy a relaxing night in with a cup of tea and a good book. </p>
