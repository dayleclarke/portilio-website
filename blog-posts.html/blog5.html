            <h2>Why I Aspire to Become a Coder</h2>
            <h3>by Dayle Clarke</h3>

            <div class="blog-post-container">
                <p class="first-para">The key reason I aspire to become a coder is that I love to code. The first time I discovered this passion was at 16 when I borrowed my brother's textbook on Programming in Delphi.  I spent the entire holidays teaching myself how to code small programs for fun, including a tic-tac toe, Magic-8 ball and encrypted message sending game. I immediately regretted not choosing technology, based subjects in school. </p>
                <p>Coding puts me in the flow state as it can provide the perfect balance of skill and challenge.  I become completely absorbed and deeply focused on solving the problem at hand, beyond the point of distraction. I feel like I am “in the zone” and that time has slowed down. Programming also feels a little bit like magic on computers. You can make elements appear, disappear, or move to give them life. I get an exciting sense of awe and wonder when I can get a computer to do what I want it to.  I love the immediate feedback it provides.</p>

                    </div>
                </blockquote>
                <p>My favourite aspect of working as a secondary school teacher was designing learning resources using technology. For example, I used If-Then formulas in Excel to provide students with immediate feedback on their work and created educational games in PowerPoint. I love creating things particularly when what I create can make the lives of others more exciting, entertaining, easy or productive. </p>

                <p>Another reason I want to become a coder is that I love problem solving and expressing my creativity. I enjoy brainstorming ways of getting software to perform a specific task or looking through code to see why it isn't working. As a teacher I get immense satisfaction out of helping my students fix a problem or bug they have in their work and have a knack for finding where they have made errors. I have meticulous attention to detail and love organising the world around me.  I enjoy keeping track of the semicolons, brackets, spacing, indentations and other small formatting details that affect the code's execution. </p>

                <p>The other appealing aspect of software development is that it is so varied and constantly evolving. I am a naturally curious person who values learning new things. It is important for me to be growing and constantly building on and improving my skillset. </p>
