Gender Disparities in Adventure Sports

Unfortunately, adventure sports, like the tech industry is dominated predominately by men. My local paragliding club for example has only 9 females out of 240 men.   A similar trend can be seen in the more adventurous high-risk styles of climbing such as multi-day, trad, alpine and aid. Women have proven time and time again to be bold, strong, confident, and competent climbers.  So where is this disparity coming from?
