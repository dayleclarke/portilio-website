How Diverse is Today's Tech Industry? 
A global software developer survey in 2021, revealed that only 5% of developers worldwide were female.  In Australia, according to the Australian Computer Society, women make up just 29 per cent of the technology workforce.  While this is more than most countries, Business Insider Australia found that Australia has one of the world's worst gender pay gaps in high-tech companies.  This highlights the importance of removing the barriers women face in the male dominated tech industry. It's crucial for all underrepresented groups to know that there's a seat for them at the table.
