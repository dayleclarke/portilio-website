            <h2 class="blog-title">Why Diversity is Good for Business  </h2>
            <p>A diverse workplace provides a powerful competitive advantage in today's globalised and interconnected world. Bringing together people with different skills, experiences, characteristics, cultures, and perspectives leads to more innovative and creative thinking. Placing people together who see the same thing in different ways, leads to new ideas, opening doors to innovation.[…]</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title"> How Do We Encourage More Women to Code?</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways of getting more women and other minority groups into tech is to encourage them at a young age to develop a love of technology (Singh, 2021). I have devoted much of my career to teaching young women how to use technology and encouraging them to pursue careers in tech. Girls can be quite apprehensive about starting their coding journey as it's typically not something they have ever considered before. Their opinions quickly change after learning they can code and how enjoyable and rewarding it is. […]</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title"> Why I Aspire to Become a Coder</h2>
            <p>The key reason I aspire to become a coder is that I love to code. The first time I discovered this passion was at 16 when I borrowed my brother's textbook on Programming in Delphi.  I spent the entire holidays teaching myself how to code small programs for fun, including a tic-tac toe, Magic-8 ball and encrypted message sending game. I immediately regretted not choosing technology, based subjects in school. […]</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">Gender Disparities in Adventure Sports</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, adventure sports, like the tech industry is dominated predominately by men. My local paragliding club for example has only 9 females out of 240 men.   A similar trend can be seen in the more adventurous high-risk styles of climbing such as multi-day, trad, alpine and aid. Women have proven time and time again to be bold, strong, confident, and competent climbers.  So where is this disparity coming from?[…]</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title">How Diverse is Today's Tech Industry?</h2>
            <p>A global software developer survey in 2021, revealed that only 5% of developers worldwide were female.  In Australia, according to the Australian Computer Society, women make up just 29 per cent of the technology workforce.  While this is more than most countries, Business Insider Australia found that Australia has one of the world;s worst gender pay gaps in high-tech companies.[…]</p>
